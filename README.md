# Dynamic Code Editor with URL Parameters

This project is a dynamic web-based code editor built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CodeMirror**. It allows users to edit JavaScript code and a custom title, then save these changes directly to the browser's URL for easy sharing and persistence.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- A **web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A **local or remote web server** to serve the HTML file (e.g., Live Server in VS Code).

### Steps to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser, or serve it locally using a tool like **Live Server**.
3. Edit the code or title as desired.
4. Click the **Save Code & Title** button to update the URL with your changes.
5. Share the URL or reload the page to see the saved state.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic behavior.
- **CodeMirror** for a rich-text JavaScript editing experience.

## Limitations
- Maximum URL length is browser-dependent (typically 2,000 to 32,768 characters).
- Sharing URLs with long code snippets may not work reliably on all platforms.

## Credits
- **CodeMirror** for the JavaScript editor.
